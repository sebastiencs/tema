//! Compositor-owned visual animation state.
//!
//! The scheduler remains the only timing authority. This module samples absolute time and describes
//! draw modifiers; it does not arm timers, choose refresh cadence, or mutate workspace layout.
//! `FocusVisualAnimation` owns the focus fade and `WindowLifecycleAnimation` owns opening.
//! `VisualAnimationPump::{advance_and_schedule, advance_and_schedule_output}` is the sole phase
//! that mutates that progress. A workspace transition in its tracking phase is the exception: a
//! touchpad swipe sets its progress. Render resolution reads the cached samples and calls the pure
//! helpers here.
//!
//! Visibility stays in the scene participation policy. Input, protocol, and render eligibility are
//! not derived from these visual modifiers. A workspace group owns one live slide-and-fade, and
//! the same animation pump samples it. Closing toplevels keep a retained snapshot.
